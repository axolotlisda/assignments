Why is it important to write clean code?
- to make it easier to read for yourself and make you remember what does the code does and for other programmers.

Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
-Revise Your Logic Before Coding
-Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page
- Use the Correct Indentation
-Write Explanatory Comments
-Avoid Abusing Comments


What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
-good comments: 

*Authoring specifications (e.g. /* Coded by John, November 13th 2010 */).
*Detailed statements on the functionality of a method or procedure (e.g. /* This function validates the login form with the aid of the e-mail check function */).
*Quick notifications or labels that state where a recent change was made (e.g. /* Added e-mail validation procedure */).


-bad comments:
-Writing explanatory notes to self (e.g. /* Will finish this later… */).
-Blaming stuff on other people (e.g. /* John coded this. Ask him. */).
-Writing vague statements (e.g. /* This is another math function. */).
-Erasing chunks of code. Sometimes people are not sure of erasing things and it’s not absolutely evil to comment that code instead.
