What is the purpose of the Rails router?
-The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action, or to a Rack application. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.

How do you assign the root route of your application in the router?
- The most important (and simplest) route in your file is the root URLâ€¦ where should users be deposited when they land on http://supercutekittenphotos.com? Just tell Rails which controller and action to map that route to, and it is so:

  root to: "kittens#index"  #kittens controller, index action (method)

Assuming we have no knowledge of the HTTP-verb, which 3 RESTful controller actions could be triggered by the /photos/:id -route?
- photos#show, photos#update and photos#destroy.

How can you assign all of the RESTful routes for a resource - excluding the destroy-route - in just one line?
- If your application has many RESTful routes, using :only and :except to generate only the routes that you actually need can cut down on memory use and speed up the routing process.

How would you create a link in your app (without hardcoding), that directs you to /photos/10/edit?
- edit_photo_path(:id) returns /photos/:id/edit (for instance, edit_photo_path(10) returns /photos/10/edit)

Which Chrome extension can you use to simulate HTTP-requests with an API?
- POSTMAN
