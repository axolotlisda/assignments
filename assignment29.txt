What is the difference between objects and arrays?
-Objects are associative arrays with several special features.
They store properties (key-value pairs), where:
Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
Values can be of any type.
while the Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

How do you access object properties?
-Dot property accessor, Square brackets property accessor,and Object destructuring.

What is Array.prototype.map() useful for?
-Map is a collection of key/value pairs that can use any type of data as a key or value and remember the order of its entries. It is used to iterate over all the elements in an array, which results in a new array. In other words, you can take an array, make changes to the elements, and get a new array based on what is returned by the function. This is why map is useful for fast searching and looking up data.

What is Array.prototype.reduce() useful for?
-The reduce method is applied to arrays in Javascript. This method does what its name says; it takes the values in an array, from the first till the last element, and applies functionality such that it changes the array into one singular value. Hence, it reduces the array.
It eliminates the need to implement for loops to traverse an array.
It allows for callbacks which save time when iterating over the array.
It allows multiple functions to be implemented on the array; sum, average, max and min values.
