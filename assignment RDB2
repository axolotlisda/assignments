What is the difference between a foreign key and a primary key?
# A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique.
# A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 

Where is the setup information for your database stored?
# The setup information for your database is stored in a special file called the “Schema”, and this is updated whenever you make changes to the structure of your database.

What are the important parts of a SQL command?
# Every CRUDdy command in SQL 

Which SQL statement is associated with “Read” from the CRUD acronym?
# “Read” queries, which use SELECT, are the most common, e.g. SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at < '2013-12-11 15:35:59 -0800'. The * you see just says “all the columns”.

Which JOIN statement keeps only the rows from both tables where they match up?
# INNER JOIN, aka JOIN – Your best friend and 95% of what you’ll use. Keeps only the rows from both tables where they match up. If you asked for all the posts for all users

How do you use an aggregate function?
# You include the function as a part of the SELECT statement, like SELECT MAX(users.age) FROM users. The function will operate on just a single column unless you specify *, which only works for some functions like COUNT (because how would you MAX a column for “name”?).

In which situation would you use the HAVING function?
# WHERE won’t work anymore. So to conditionally retrieve records based on aggregate functions, you use the HAVING function, which is essentially the WHERE for aggregates.

Why can’t I just use Ruby to process my database data?
# SQL is faster than Ruby!
Learning this stuff is particularly relevant because it’s MUCH faster for you to build queries that use SQL intelligently than to just grab a whole bunch of data out of your database and then use Ruby to process it.
