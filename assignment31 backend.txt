What problems do frameworks solve?
Basically, a web framework makes it easier for you to develop your application. Most sites have a common set of functionality (like handling sessions, data validation, etc) and a framework is something that prevents you from re-writing this each time you create a website.
Some web frameworks were initially created to solve certain types of problems, and remain better at creating web apps with similar constraints. For example, Django was created to support development of a newspaper website, so it's good for blogs and other sites that involve publishing things. By contrast, Flask is a much lighter-weight framework and is great for creating web apps running on embedded devices. 


Name some popular front-end and back-end frameworks.
-frontend - Vue, angularJS, Angular 2+, React, Ember.
-backend - Spring MVC, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, Meteor, Express.

Describe the process of choosing a framework.
-You should look on Effort to learn from easy to hard ones, the productivity many factors affecting productivity are similar to those for effort to learn, Framework purpose some web framwork are initially created to solve certain problems, opinionated vs unopinionated sometimes opinionated frameworks are the ones who is more productive however may be less flexible, batteries included vs. get it yourself some web framworks include tools/libraries that addess every problem however if a smaller framework  has everything you will ever need then it can run in more constrained environments and will have a smaller and easier subset of things to learn. Performance of the framework/programming language: Usually "speed" is not the biggest factor in selection because even relatively slow runtimes like Python are more than "good enough" for mid-sized sites running on moderate hardware,Caching support As your website becomes more successful then you may find that it can no longer cope with the number of requests it is receiving as users access it Returning a cached response is much faster than calculating one in the first place. Caching can be implemented in your code or in the server, Scalability: Once your website is fantastically successful you will exhaust the benefits of caching and even reach the limits of vertical scaling (running your web application on more powerful hardware). Web security: Some web frameworks provide better support for handling common web attacks.
