What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
- Understanding the problem,  Plan/Strategizing(Pseudocode), Divide and Conquer(Implementing).

Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
-If you understand the problem then you will know if  you've sucessfully solved the problem or not. Plus it will save you some time from having to writae the wrong solution.

What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
- Write it down on paper on plain english to understand it better.

What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
- If the program has interface then what will it look like, the functionality of the interface. if it hs these things, sketch it out on paper. 
- What input will the program have? is it user input or will you get it somewhere?
-what is the desired output.
- given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

What is an algorithm?
- algorithm is like a recipe for solving particular roblem. It defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer so solve a problem in pseudocode.
-algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomlishing a task.

What is pseudocode?
- pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language.

What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
-picking the smallest or simplest problem first gives you headstart on the bigger problems. You can solve smallers problems first until you solve big problem.
