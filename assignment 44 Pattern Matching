What is pattern matching?
# Pattern matching is a feature allowing deep matching of structured values: checking the structure and binding the matched parts to local variables.

What is the difference between array patterns and hash patterns?
# Array patterns and find patterns match arrays, or objects that respond to deconstruct. 
# Hash patterns match hashes, or objects that respond to deconstruct_keys. Note that only symbol keys are supported for hash patterns.

What is the variable pattern match?
# The variable pattern binds a variable or variables to the values that match the pattern.

What are the different ways of pattern matching on an array?
# Matching against arrays can be done in a few different ways. At its most basic, you can match against the exact elements in the array.

Explain the find pattern.
# It works by placing a * either side of the part you want to match. You can even use the variable pattern to give each * a variable name to reference later. Letâ€™s look at some examples.
