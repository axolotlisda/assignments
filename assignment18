-using the flex-direction: column; .

-the height instead of width.

In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
-the width

Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
-because they are different questions which requires different answer.
-because column flex-container has vertical direction that is why the flex-basis's value will be put to the height and vice versa to the row ones.
